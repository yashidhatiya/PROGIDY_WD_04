            <h3>Project 2</h3> <h3>Operating system</h3>
             <p>A computer system consists of many resources like hardware and software, which are useful to complete a task. 
                  The common required resources are input/ output devices, memory, file storage space, CPU etc.
                 The operating system acts as a manager for all the above resources and allocates them to specific programs and users, whenever necessary to perform a particular task. An operating system is the interface between the user and the machine. Here our main goal is finding the new ideas for involving existing computer operating systems.
